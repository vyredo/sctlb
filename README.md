## Note

Hey there! Task completed! ðŸŽ‰

- The task are quite big especially since I have to create several component from scratch and create unittest for each file.
- I decide to keep design simple to save time.
- Focused on key features for ya! Let me know what you think. ðŸ˜Š

### Unfamiliar tool

- It's impossible to be familiar with all Js libraries and css preprocessor like: `stylex`, `tailwind`, `bootstrap`, `mui`, `less`, `postcss`
- I'm not really acquainted with tailwindcss, Although <strong>I am perfectly fine learning new tools</strong>, but to use unfamiliar tool within 7 days for the entire app seems a bit risky.
- So, I've opted for simple CSS. Using Scss is mainly for generating those handy vendor prefix tags.
